# family-scheduler

🎭 Welcome to the most chaotic family scheduler you'll ever encounter! This masterpiece of digital
confusion is proudly built with complete disregard for Vue.js 3 and Vite conventions. You'll find a
beautiful mess of AI-generated code that somehow works.

Features include:

- Questionable code architecture that would make Vue.js creators cry
- Creative interpretations of Vite best practices (we made our own!)
- Some non-declared AI-generated code with 1% human confusion added for flavor
- Probably works on your machine (no promises though)

Use at your own risk. Side effects may include headaches, confusion, and uncontrollable urges to
refactor everything.
